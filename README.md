# The Know CS Application

Know CS, or "Know Computer Science" is a simple quiz application, designed to teach and reinforce computer science concepts, algorithms, and data structures.
The app features a ten question interface, which prompts the user to choose from a selection of multiple choice answers, and gives the user a score once all responses have been submitted. The questions are sourced from a Postgres database, containing over 50 CS multiple-choice questions.
